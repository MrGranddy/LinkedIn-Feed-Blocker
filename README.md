# LinkedIn Feed Blocker

A simple Chrome extension that blocks the LinkedIn feed content. Keep on networking and do your job search while being shielded from LinkedIn content. (Just removes all posts from the feed.)

## Features

- Blocks the LinkedIn feed content
- Simple and lightweight
- No data collection or tracking
- Works across all LinkedIn pages

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

## Important Note
This extension makes purely local changes to your browser's display of LinkedIn content. It does not interact with LinkedIn's servers, modify any data, or violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service. The feed blocking is achieved through client-side CSS and JavaScript that only affects how content is displayed in your browser.

## Contributing

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 

Tired of blocking people one by one? Sick of seeing the same generic content spammed to your face? This extension was created to solve exactly that, just remove the feed entirely! 

If you know your way around Chrome extensions, JavaScript, or CSS, and you'd like to help improve this little project, all contributions are welcome.

## How it works
The extension hides the main feed element on LinkedIn using a simple content script.
